Exercise 1: Implement filter function in Java.

 odd x = (x%2)!=0
 filter ([1,2,3,4],odd) ->  [1,3]


Exercise 2. Using the Bank solution of TAP1, the goal is that Bank implements Itrable. Use the Java "for" iterator to traverse the Accounts in a Bank.


Exercise 3:  Binary Search Tree
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree

A BSTree is a tree with two children: left one  and right one.
It must meet the property that each node of the tree contains an element that is higher than
the element on the left and lower than the element of the right branch. To insert an item
the tree you must first recursively search the position of the tree where you must insert the new data.
To find an item in the tree you also need to to search recursively the right position.

Implement methods to insert an item in the tree and a method contains (element) that tells us if
the tree containing the element. Note that element may be of any type.

1) Insert in a BSTree of Integers the following values: 5,3,6,1,4 and then search if contains 4 and 6.
Recommendation: Use Comparator<T> in the constructor if BSTree to allow comparison
between nodes of the tree.

2) Make the BSTree iterable with the new loop of JDK 1.5

3) Make another version of BSTree which will not pass the Comparator in the constructor.
Instead assume that the elements containing the tree implement the Comparable interface.

4) Create a BSTree of Cars in a Main.

5) Subclass BSTree using bounded type parameters to create a BSCarTree. Create a method in Car called claxon that prints
 "MEEEC". Then create a method in BSCarTree that invokes claxon in the tree of cars in a recursive way.

Example Main:
 BSTree<Integer> tree = new BSTree<Integer>(new Comparaint());
 tree.insert(5);
 tree.insert(3);
 tree.insert(6);
 tree.insert(1);
 tree.insert(4);
 System.out.println(tree.contains(4));
 System.out.println(tree.contains(8));
 for (Integer elem:tree)
   System.out.println(elem);

Exercise 4: In map2.Map, change the code to enable map return a different type of List<R>
than the one passed by parameter List<T>. Show an example where from a list of Strings with map
and a Lambda we can obtain a List<Integer> with the sizes of each String.


Exercise 5: We will import information from the accounts.txt file in CSV format (Comma separated values). Use TAP1/other/Tokens.
Import this information in a List of Accounts where the four parameters correspond to:
  id :String, owner:String, type:enum[IF,CA,BA,SA], balance:double
Perform the following operations:
 Use stream.map to increment the balance of all accounts in 10 euros
 Use stream.filter to obtain all account of type IF
 Use stream.max to obtain the account with the highest balance
 Combine filter and max to obtain the IF account with higher balance

Exercise 6. The goal is to implement an algorithm that counts all words in a text file. The algorithm must
return a Map<String,Integer> or Map<String,Long> where the key is the word and the value is the number of occurrences
of that word.

Exercise 7. Use stream().parallel() to accelerate the previous algorithm for big files. You can use guava.AtomicLongMap if needed.
Compare times in your machine.
